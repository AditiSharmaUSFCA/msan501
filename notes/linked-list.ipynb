If we do this with lists implemented as contiguous arrays (made up of contiguous cells in memory), we have to move a lot of cells around to make room for a new element or to close a hole made by a deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Linked list* implementations of abstract lists allow us to efficiently insert and remove things anywhere we want. This flexibility comes at the cost of more memory.\n",

    "Imagine that I wanted to take roll in class. Since everyone is sitting next to each other, i.e. contiguous, I can simply point from one person to the next by looking to the left or right. That's the way lists work, as contiguous chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list requires everybody to not only remember their name but also who is to the right of them (a next pointer).  As long as I remember the first person (the head) in the list, I can call that person later and ask for their name. Then I can ask them to refer to the next person in line.  This works even if people distribute across the continent or randomly reassign where they are sitting. There is no requirement that these elements be contiguous because each node in the list has the information needed to get to the next person.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list implementation associates a next pointer with each list value. We call these things *nodes* usually: `[value,next]` or `(value,next)`. We also keep a pointer to the *head* of the list and sometimes the *tail* of the list.\n",
    "\n",
