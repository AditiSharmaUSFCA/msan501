    "\n",
    "The goal of this lecture-lab is to learn how to extract data from files on your laptop's disk. We'll load words from a text file and numbers from data files.  Along the way, we'll learn more about filenames and paths to files. The first two elements of our generic analytics program template says to acquire data and then load it into a data structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Acquire data, which means finding a suitable file or collecting data from the web and storing in a file\n",
    "2. Load data from disk and place into memory organized into data structures\n",

    "For now, we'll satisfy the first step by just downloading ready-made data files from the web by hand. In [MSAN692 -- Data Acquisition](https://github.com/parrt/msan692), we'll learn all about how to pull data from the web programmatically. This lecture focuses on the second step in the analytics program template."

    "## What are files?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've discussed before, both the disk and RAM are forms of memory. RAM is much faster (but smaller) than the disk but RAM all disappears when the power goes out. Disks, on the other hand, are persistent. A file is simply a chunk of data on the disk identified by a filename. You use files all the time. For example, we can double-click on a text file or Excel file, which opens an application to display those files. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to be able to write Python programs that read data from files just like, say, Excel does.  Accessing data in RAM is very easy in a Python program, we simply refer to the various elements in a list using an index, such as `names[i]`.  File data is less convenient to access  because we have to explicitly load the file into working memory first.  For example, we might want to load a list of names from a file into a `names` list. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a file is too big to fit into memory all at once, we have to process the data in chunks.  For now, let's assume all files fit in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, accessing files is a bit of a hassle because we must explicitly tell Python to open a file and then close it when we're done. We also must distinguish between reading and writing from/to a file, which dictates the mood in which we open the file.  We can open the file in read, write, or append mode. For this lab, we will only concern ourselves with the default case of \"opening a file for reading.\" Here is how to open a file called `foo.txt` in read mode (the default) then immediately close that file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f = open('foo.txt')  # open for read mode\n",
    "f.close()            # ok, we're done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm...what kind of object is returned from `open()` and stored in `f`? Why do we have to close files?"

    "You know what a file name is because you've created lots of files before. (BTW, another reminder not to use spaces in your file or directory names.) *Paths* are what we call fully qualified filenames because they give a description of the directories from the root of the file system. The root of the file system is identified with `/` forward slashat the start of a pathname. You are probably used to seeing it as \"Macintosh HD\" but from a programming point of view, it's just `/`. Here's a useful diagram showing the components of a fully qualified pathname to a file called `view.py`:\n",

    "\n",
    "The last element in a path is either a filename or a directory. For example to refer to the directory holding `view.py` in the above diagram, use path `/Users/parrt/classes/msan501/images-parrt`. Or, using the shortcut, the fully qualified path is `~/classes/msan501/images-parrt`. Here's an example bash session that uses some fully qualified paths:\n",

So, if a program is running inside the directory `~/classes/msan501/images-parrt`, then the program could refer to any data files sitting in that directory with just a file name--no path is required.  For example, let's use the `ls` program to demonstrate the different kinds of paths.\n",

    "\n",
    "Text files are usually 1 byte per character (8 bits) and have the notion of a line. A line is just a sequence of characters terminated with either `\\r\\n` (Windows) or `\\n` (UNIX, Mac). A text file is usually then a sequence of lines. Download this sample text file, [IntroIstanbul.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parrt/msan501/master/notes/data/IntroIstanbul.txt) so we have something to work with. You can save it in `/tmp` or whatever directory you are using for in class work. For the purposes of this discussion, I have data files in a subdirectory called `data` of this notes directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's examine the contents of the file in a raw fashion rather than with a text editor. The `od` command (octal dump) is useful for looking at the bytes of the file. Use option `-c` to see the contents as 1-byte characters:"
