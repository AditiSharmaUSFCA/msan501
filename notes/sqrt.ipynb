    "# Approximating square root\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of useful functions that have no closed form solution, meeting we can't just do a commutation and return the value. Instead, we need to use an iterative method to approximate the function value. We can use this to approximate sine (with Taylor series expansion), approximate square root (as we'll do in this lecture), or optimize a cost or error function (gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous uniform random variable lecture, we must translate a recurrence relation to Python.  Instead of returning a single value in the recurrence, we will look for convergence of the series. In other words, if we run the series out far enough, we will get a very accurate approximation to square root. This will teach us the basics of iterative computing to prepare us for the more complicated function optimization material.\n"

    "To approximate square root, the idea is to pick an initial estimate, $x_0$, and then iterate with better and better estimates, $x_i$, using the ([Babylonian method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method)) recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_i + \\frac{n}{x_i})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereâ€™s a great deal on the web you can read to learn more about why this process works but it relies on the average (midpoint) of $x_i$ and $n/x_i$ getting us closer to the square root of n. The cool thing is that the iteration converges quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to write a function that takes a single number and returns it square root. What we know about this function before even beginning to code? Well, we have a clear description of the problem per our function workplan, and we also have the function signature we want:\n",

    "\n",
    "The terminating condition of the loop is when we have reached convergence or close to it. Convergence just means that $x_{i+1}$ is pretty close to $x_i$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Iterative method outline\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we have an outline for an analytics program, iterative methods all share the same basic outline. (I'm assuming here that $x_{i+1}$ depends only on a single previous value and that $i$ implicitly increments as the loop goes around.)\n",

    "return $x_{i+1}$*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Python does not have a repeat until loop, we figured with an infinite loop containing a conditional that breaks us out upon convergence:\n",

Here is a Python implementation that tracks only two values and follows the infinite loop pattern:"
