    "# Organizing your code with functions\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pestle.png\" style=\"width:90px\" align=\"right\"> Years ago I learned to make Thai red curry paste from scratch, including roasting then grinding seeds and pounding stuff in a giant mortar and pestle. It takes forever and so I generally buy curry paste ready-made from the store. If you look at any cookbook, you will see a number of fundamental recipes, such as making sauces, that are used by other recipes. A cookbook is organized into a series of executable recipes, some of which \"invoke\" other recipes. To make dinner, I open a cookbook, acquire some raw ingredients, then execute one or more recipes, usually in a specific sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a program proceeds in the same way. Opening a cookbook is the same as importing libraries. Acquiring raw ingredients means loading data in the memory. The main program  invokes functions (recipes) to accomplish a particular task. As part of writing a program, we will typically break out logical sections of code into functions specific to our problem, whereas the functions in libraries tend to be broadly-applicable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we organize our code is important. Programs quickly become an incomprehensible rats nest if we are not strict about style and organization. Here is the general structure of the Python programs you will write:\n",
    "\n",
    "*import any libraries*<br>\n",
    "*define any constants, simple data values*<br>\n",
    "*define any functions*<br>\n",
    "*main program body*\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Functions](functions.md), we discussed the idea of functions using pseudocode and now it's time to look at some concrete function definitions. A function with one argument in Python looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`def` *funcname*`(`*argname*`)`:<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*statement 1*<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*statement 2*<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*...*<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`return` *expression*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where the `return` statement is omitted if the function does not return a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Statements are associated with the function by indentation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are two arguments, the function header looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`def` *funcname*`(`*argname1*, *argname2*`)`:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our job as programmers is to pick a descriptive function name, argument name(s), and statements within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invoking a function** looks like *funcname*`(`*expression*`)` or *funcname*`(`*expression1*`,` *expression2*`)` etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the code snippets from [Programming Patterns in Python](python-patterns.ipynb) and see if we can abstract some useful functions."
