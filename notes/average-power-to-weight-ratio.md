## Power to weight ratio

The goal of this exercise is to compute the average horsepower of 8-cylinder engines from a [sample data set](../data/cars.xls). The first few rows look like:

Follow the process in our [program work plan](plans/program-planning.pdf). Hints: For the sample input-output pairs step of the design process, I actually manually do some interactive work in a spreadsheet. Here is one experiment in process:

While we're at it, let's also figure out which row of data represents the most powerful car, which we can define as the maximum power to weight ratio. The problems are very similar, except now we don't care about the average.
