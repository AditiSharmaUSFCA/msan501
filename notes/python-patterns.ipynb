    "# Programming Patterns in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got an overall strategy and plan for designing programs, let's look at a few implementations for the [high-level programming operations](operations.md), such as Map, Filter, Combine, etc... Each of those operations has an implementation using conditional and loop patterns, which we can very easily express using python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go through, you will see that program design and coding are a game of word association. A high-level operation, such as map, should trigger a pseudocode loop template in your mind, which should then trigger a for-each Python code template.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep in mind that we design programs by selecting and applying operations, not specific code sequences. Coding is the final act in the design process where we get an executable document.* So, think visually about how you would manipulate lists of data or extract information from data. I often draw things out or put them into a spreadsheet to help me visualize. Manually moving some data around on paper helps me to understand the operations to perform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After designing a sequence or combination of high-level operations, we can write things out in pseudocode or go straight to Python syntax. As you gain more experience, it will be easier to go straight from the operation to the code, but we still design programs using operations, not code, in our head. For complex problems, I still write out pseudocode, despite 35+ years coding experience."
