    "# Programming Patterns in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an understanding of how computers organize data and have some low level programming operations, let's look at a few common high-level programming patterns. Each of these operations has an implementation using conditional and loop patterns, which we can very easily express using python syntax. We can also use existing library functions to achieve the same thing, which we'll explore also.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go through, you will see that program design and coding are a game of word association. A high-level operation, such as map, should trigger a pseudocode (English-like \"code\") loop template in your mind, which should then trigger a for-each Python code template.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep in mind that we design programs by selecting and applying operations, not specific code sequences. Coding is the final act in the design process where we get an executable document.* So, think visually about how you would manipulate lists of data or extract information from data. I often draw things out or put them into a spreadsheet to help me visualize. Manually moving some data around on paper helps me to understand the operations to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "After designing a sequence or combination of high-level operations, we can write things out in pseudocode or go straight to Python syntax. As you gain more experience, it will be easier to go straight from the operation to the code, but we still design programs using operations, not code, in our head. For complex problems, I still write out pseudocode, despite 35+ years coding experience."

    "Programmers draw from a set of patterns or templates when choosing an overall program plan. The same is true of the individual operations themselves.  Programmers have a catalog of common operations that they rely on when choosing the steps of a plan.\n",

    "\n",
    "* *sum the numbers in a list*\n",
    "* *count the numbers in a list*.\n",
