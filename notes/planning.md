# Program planning

*in progress*

A program is a sequence of operations that transforms data or performs computations that ultimately lead to the expected output. *Programming* is the act of designing programs: identifying the operations and their appropriate sequence.  In other words, programming is about coming up with a work plan intended for a computer, which we'll describe in semi-precise English called *pseudocode*. *Coding* is the act of mapping such high-level pseudocode to programming language syntax. We'll worry about the actual [coding](coding.md) part later, after we learn how to design programs.
â€¨At this point, we have an excellent foundation to start building programs because we have an [overall problem-solving strategy](programming.md) and a generic program outline to get us started.  Let's summarize our strategy:

1. Clearly articulate the problem were trying to solve
2. Figure out what data we need
3. Manually write out input-output pairs
4. Identify a suitable sequence of operations
5. Code the problem
6. Verify that the program generates the correct output

and our overall analytics program outline:

1. Acquire data
2. Load data into a data structure
2. Normalize, clean, or otherwise prepare data
3. Process the data
4. Emit results
