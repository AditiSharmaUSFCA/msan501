# Functions (subprograms)

At this point, you should be getting pretty tired of repeating the sequence of operations in your program work plans that computes the average of some numbers:

* Use accumulator to sum the values<br>
* Use accumulator to count the values<br>
* If the count is 0, the average is 0 else compute the average as the sum divided by the count

The sequence is identical in all of the examples we've done so far; the only change is the list of numbers to which we apply the operations.  With some experience, we've learned to repeat that sequence every time we need to compute the average. It's exactly like learning to spit out the words for "*where is the subway?*" in a foreign language.

Now, let's bake that experience into a single entity, called a **function** or **procedure** or **method**, that formalizes the notion of reusing a sequence of operations.  For convenience, we're going to refer to this sequence by name, such as "*average*." Then, we can say things like invoke "*average of unit prices*" or "*average of rainfall*" to apply the sequence of operations to a specific list.  For example, the processing steps for [rainfall average](images/rainfall-average-plan.png) could be rewritten more simply as:

* Load the numbers into a list in memory
* Search for 999 in the list
* Slice out all numbers up to but not including 999â€™s position
* <s>Use accumulator to sum the values<br>
* Use accumulator to count the values<br>
* If the count is 0, the average is 0 else compute the average as the sum divided by the count</s>
* **Invoke the *average* computation on the rainfall subset**
* Print the average

Reusing someone else's proven sequence of operations is  something we do all the time in the real world.  For example, we reuse recipes from a cookbook when making dinner.  Each recipe has a name, a list of ingredients, a sequence of operations, and (returns) a final product.  Here's how I could describe my awesome recipe for making snow: 

**name**: `snow`<br>
**ingredients**: multiple ice cubes<br>
**result**: some snow<br>
**steps**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put ice in blender<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn on blender for 10 seconds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dump out the snow into a bowl

Functions are just like recipes except that the sequence of operations has to be more precise, since we will ultimately need to have an intolerant computer execute the sequence.

As a more realistic example, consider the [formula for a line](https://www.mathsisfun.com/equation_of_line.html) from algebra: *y* = *mx* + *b* where *m* is the slope and *b* is the y-intercept. Here's a line at 45 degrees (slope 1) crossing the y-axis at 2: *y* = *x* + *2*. Another way to write that is *line(x)* = *x* + *2*, which we can describe as:

**name**: *line*<br>
**ingredients**: *x* coordinate<br>
**result**: *y* coordinate associated with *x*<br>
**steps**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compute *x* + *2*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return that value

Now that we have the basic idea, let's take a more formal look at designing functions.
 
## Functions are subprograms

A sequence of operations grouped into a single, named entity is called a **function**. Functions are like mini programs or subprograms that we can plan out just like full programs.  

Python **programs** consist of zero or more functions and the so-called "main" program, consisting of a sequence of operations that gets the ball rolling.

Instead of loading data from the disk, functions operate on data given to them from the invoking program. This incoming data is analogous to a recipe's list of ingredients and is specified in the form of one or more named *parameters* (also called *arguments*). Instead of printing a result or displaying a graph, as a program would, functions *return* values.  

We begin planning a function by identifying:
 
1. a descriptive function name
2. the kind of value(s) it operates on (parameter types)
3. the kind of value it returns (return type)
4. what the function does

These function planning steps are essentially the first two steps from our program problem-solving strategy where we  identify what kind of input we have and what the expected result is. 

Then we manually write out some sample function invocations to show what data goes in and what data comes out. 

Next, we plan out the sequence of operations needed by the function to compute the desired result.  As when designing a whole program, we start with the return value and work our way backwards, identifying operations in reverse order. Note: The operations should be purely a function of the data passed to them as parameters---functions should be completely ignorant of any other data. (More on this when we actually translate function pseudocode to Python.) 

## Examples

**Exercise**. Fill out a [Function work plan](plans/function-planning.pdf) for a function that computes *y = x + 2*.

**Exercise**. Fill out a [Function work plan](plans/function-planning.pdf) for a function that computes the average of some numbers.

This last one has a bit of a wrinkle when describing the input parameter for the sample parameter-result pairs. When writing these out, we're going to get get a little closer to actual Python function invocation syntax because it is quite readable. Instead of saying, "*average of 3 returns 3*" in pure English, let's use something like this:

`average( 3 )` returns 3

where the parentheses group the sole argument.  Unfortunately, that syntax is not quite good enough.  For one thing, the average function takes a parameter whose data type is a list not just a number. Secondly, when there is more than one number in the list, we can't use a simple comma-separated list:

`average( 1, 2, 6 )` returns 4.5

That makes it look like the average function takes three parameters. Instead, let's group the numbers together using square brackets, which happens to be exactly how Python represents list, but also make sense in English:

`average( [1, 2, 6] )` returns 4.5

That definitely looks more like average takes a single, albeit complex, parameter. To specify an empty list then we can just use square brackets without any elements:

`average( [ ] )` returns 0

If we instead used `average( )`, it would look like the function doesn't take any arguments, which is incorrect.
