# Functions (subprograms)

At this point, you should be getting pretty tired of repeating the sequence of operations in your program work plans that computes the average of some numbers:

> Use accumulator to sum the values<br>
Use accumulator to count the values<br>
If the count is 0, the average is 0<br>else compute the average as the sum divided by the count

The sequence is identical in all of the examples we've done so far; the only change is the list of numbers to which we apply the sequence.  

With some experience, we've learned to repeat that sequence every time we need to compute the average.  Let's freeze dry that experienceof cutting and pasting, let's formalize the notion of reusing a sequence of operations.   In fact, it would be very convenient if we could simply refer to a sequence by name, such as "*average*." Then, we could say things like "*average of unit prices*" or "*average of rainfall*" to apply the sequence of operations to a specific list.  For example, the processing steps for [rainfall average](images/rainfall-average-plan.png) could then be rewritten as:

> Load the numbers into a list in memory<br>
Search for 999 in the list<br>
Slice out all numbers up to but not including 999â€™s position<br>
Print the average of the rainfall subset<br>
